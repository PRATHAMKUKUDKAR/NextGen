# Backup Router Using TFTP Server

## Purpose of Backup
- To save the routerâ€™s configuration file externally so it can be restored in case of failure, corruption, or migration.
- Ensures network continuity and avoids reconfiguring from scratch.

## TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
- A simple protocol to transfer files over a network.
- Lightweight, does not require authentication, and works best in trusted LAN environments.
- Commonly used for router/switch configuration backups.
